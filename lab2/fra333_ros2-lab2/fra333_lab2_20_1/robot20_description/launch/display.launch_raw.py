    ### How to get path of a file from "install" directory ###
    #
    ## If our custom package [package_name] consists of a folder [folder_name].
    ## And inside that folder, there is a file name [file_name.extension].
    ## This is how to get full path to the file (in a form of string)

    # path_to_package = get_package_share_directory(package_name)
    # sub_folder = 'folder_name'
    # file_name = 'file_name.extension'
    # file_path = os.path.join(path_to_package,sub_folder,file_name) 
    
    ## You must build the custom package before. Otherwise, these codes will not find the file
    # in "install" directory

    ### How to run rviz2 ###
    #
    ## With -d rviz_file_path, you can load the previous setting of rviz
    #
    # rviz = Node(
    #    package='rviz2',
    #    executable='rviz2',
    #    name='rviz',
    #    arguments=['-d', rviz_file_path],
    #    output='screen')
    
    ### How to read URDF file ###
    #
    # Assume that you have the correct path [robot_description_path]
    # with open(robot_description_path, 'r') as infp:
    #     robot_description = infp.read()
    
    ### How to run robot_state_publisher ###
    #
    # You must have a valid robot_description
    #
    # robot_state_publisher = Node(package='robot_state_publisher',
    #                               executable='robot_state_publisher',
    #                               output='screen',
    #                               parameters=[
    #                                 {'use_sim_time': 'false'},
    #                                 {'robot_description': robot_description}
    #                               ]
    # )

    ### How to add actions to launch description ###
    #
    # You must create an object called "LaunchDescription"
    # and add actions one by one
    #
    # Launch Description
    # launch_description = LaunchDescription()
    # launch_description.add_action(rviz)
    # launch_description.add_action(robot_state_publisher)
    
    return launch_description
